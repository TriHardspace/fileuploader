# File-Uploader
A simple PHP file uploader service, powered by Bootstrap. This project is currently hosted at https://files.icurriculum.co/. 



## How to use.
1. Make sure PHP is enabled in your web server of choice.
2. Change `https://your_host_here.com` in `fileupload.php` to the url of your host.
3. Copy the project files to your webserver.
4. Create a directory called uploads, make sure the permissions are 0777.


## Drawbacks / Todo
- [ ] Currently, the page that displays the location the file is uploaded at does not have a download button.
- [ ] Currently, there is no clickable link on the page that displays the file download location, mainly because it was causing issues with PHP.
- [ ] The entire site looks pretty scuffed on mobile, that should be addressed.

# File-Uploader
A simple PHP File uploader service, powered by Bootstrap.


## How to use.
1. Make sure PHP is enabled in your web server of choice.
2. Copy the project files to your webserver.
3. Create a directory called uploads.


## Drawbacks / Todo
1. Currently, the page that displays the location the file is uploaded at does not have a download button.
2. Currently, there is no clickable link on the page that displays the file download location, mainly because it was causing issues with PHP.
